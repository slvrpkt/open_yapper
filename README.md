## Non-Technical Setup (Install It Once, Use It Anytime)

If you want Open Yapper on your computer like a normal app (without opening Cursor/IDE every time), follow this:

### macOS download status

The macOS prebuilt download is currently unavailable on the website.

### Build your own installable app from this repo (macOS)

Use this if you want your own personal build from source code.

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd open_yapper
```

2. Install Flutter automatically (recommended):

```bash
bash scripts/setup_flutter_macos.sh
```

If you prefer manual installation, use the official guide: [Flutter install guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos)

3. Run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build macos --release
```

4. When build finishes, open this folder:

```bash
build/macos/Build/Products/Release/
```

5. Drag `open_yapper.app` into **Applications**
6. Launch from Applications from now on (no IDE needed)

### First launch checklist

- Allow **Microphone** permission
- Allow **Accessibility** permission (for pasting into other apps)
- Paste your Gemini API key in onboarding (or later in Settings)

### How to update later

When you want a newer version from source:

```bash
git pull
flutter pub get
flutter build macos --release
```

Then replace the old app in Applications with the new `open_yapper.app`.

## What is Open Yapper?

**Open Yapper** (OY!) is the GEN Z voice dictation app. It's an open-source clone of [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/)—ramble naturally, AI cleans the mess, no cap.

Stop typing, start talking. Speak into your mic, and Open Yapper transcribes your voice, removes filler words (um, uh, like, you know), and turns your rambled thoughts into polished text ready to paste anywhere—Gmail, Slack, Notes, ChatGPT, you name it.

### Key Features

- **Voice-to-text transcription** — Record your voice and get clean, formatted text
- **Filler word removal** — Automatically strips "um," "uh," "like," and other verbal hiccups
- **Gen Z mode** — Optional rewrite into Gen Z slang (lowkey, no cap, slay, it's giving, etc.)
- **Per-app customization** — Set tone (casual, formal, etc.) and target app hints
- **Global hotkeys** — Press **⌥ Space** (Option+Space) to start/stop recording on macOS
- **History & stats** — Browse past recordings, copy text, and see usage stats
- **Paste anywhere** — Uses accessibility APIs to paste directly into the focused app

### Tech Stack

- **Flutter** — Cross-platform (macOS, iOS, Android, Web, Windows)
- **Google Gemini** — AI transcription and text refinement
- **Native macOS integration** — Hotkeys, accessibility, microphone permissions

## Download

**Website:** [www.openyapper.com](https://www.openyapper.com)

The website is currently the landing page only.  
The macOS prebuilt app is temporarily unavailable, so please clone this repository and build your own release (`flutter build macos --release`) using the guide above.

## How to Run (Development)

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (3.10+)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) 3.10+
- A [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) (free tier available)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/open_yapper.git
cd open_yapper
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Add your Gemini API key

The app requires a Gemini API key for transcription. On first launch, you'll see an onboarding screen where you can paste your key. It's stored securely in the system keychain (macOS) or equivalent.

You can also set it via the Settings screen after onboarding.

### 4. Run the app

**macOS (primary platform):**

```bash
flutter run -d macos
```

**Other platforms:**

```bash
# iOS (requires Xcode and a Mac)
flutter run -d ios

# Android
flutter run -d android

# Web
flutter run -d chrome

# Windows
flutter run -d windows
```

### 5. Grant permissions

On first run, the app will ask for:

- **Microphone** — To record your voice
- **Accessibility** — To paste text into other apps (macOS)

Grant both in System Settings when prompted.

### 6. Start recording

- Press **⌥ Space** (Option+Space) to toggle recording
- Or hold the hotkey to record while pressed
- Speak naturally—the AI will clean up filler words and format the output
- The text is pasted into the currently focused app when done
